CSC 172 lab 06 had us implement a binary search tree data structure. The search tree itself supports basic operations like insertion, deletion, retrieval, etc. as well as two iterators, one which traverses in level order and one which traverses inorder. The UnitTest class contains the main method which gives benchmarks for all methods and iterators. Some methods may be used internally and are vital to other methods working properly, and are therefore not called explicitly in the unit tests (ex: the toString method traverses the tree with the level order iterator).
